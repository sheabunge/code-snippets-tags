Organize your code snippets with tags. Adds support to the Code Snippets WordPress plugin for adding tags to snippets.

== Description ==

Adds support to the Code Snippets WordPress plugin for adding tags to snippets. Requires [Code Snippets](http://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets) 1.8 or later.

You can assign tags to snippets using an interactive UI when editing or adding a new snippet. Then, you can filter snippets by tag on the snippets table, or see what tags are assigned to a particular snippet with a glance at the new table column. Tags are stored in your database and can be exported and imported along with the other snippet data.
